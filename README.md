# Background
## Binary Tree 

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It's a fundamental building block for many other data structures and algorithms.

### Key Characteristics:

`Root:` The topmost node in the tree.

`Nodes:` Each element in the tree, containing data and references (or links) to its children.

`Edges:` The connections between nodes representing the parent-child relationship.

`Leaf Nodes:` Nodes without any children.

`Levels:` The depth of a node, with the root at level 0.

## Definitions: 
`Serialize:` To converting a data structure into a linear format.

`Deserialize:` To reconstructing a data structure from a linear format.


## Question 
### Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree:

Serialize a binary tree to a string and deserialize it back to the original tree structure.


### Example Tree:
```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \   \
  4   5   6 
```
